### Introduction to the Genome Institute
Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a new national research institute jointly organized by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Shenzhen Municipality. In the past four years since its establishment, the Institute has fulfilled its national mission of "leaping to the top of the world in agricultural science and technology and serving the major scientific and technological needs of the industry", served the strategic deployment of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the construction of the Shenzhen International Science and Technology Industrial Innovation Center, and built a leading international "germplasm resource collection - genome sequencing and analysis - functional gene We have introduced more than 40 internationally competitive PIs and recruited more than 150 postdocs;.

we have made outstanding achievements in the fields of basic agricultural biomics, genomics and plant and animal molecular breeding, genomics and plant and animal health. We have made outstanding achievements in the fields of basic agricultural biomics, genomics and plant and animal molecular breeding, genomics and plant and animal health, etc. We have published more than 300 SCI papers in Science, Nature, Cell, Nature Genetics and other famous journals, which have established the international status of Chinese agricultural genomics.

### About Wang Lab

Prof.Wang, the lead scientist of the team, received his undergraduate degree in Biotechnology from South China University of Technology in 2010. He received his Ph.D. in genetics from the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2016. He conducted postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Professor Rasmus Nielsen, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a renowned population geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley. 2022 joined the Shenzhen Institute of Agricultural Genomics, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, as a group leader in October 2022.

Hongru Wang's team has a long-standing interest in evolutionary genetics theory and methods, and has conducted empirical studies based on a variety of biological models, including rice. The main research interest is to resolve genomic natural variation patterns, reconstruct key events in population history, and lay the foundation for understanding population-level natural variation. By combining population genetics and molecular biology, he has resolved the genetic basis of natural variation in important traits and revealed their evolutionary patterns. Representative works include the analysis of the genetic and ecological adaptation mechanism of OsTCP19, the main gene for nitrogen fertilizer adaptation in rice. 

Global climate change is a major challenge for future agriculture, and the group is currently using the genus rice as a model to deeply explore and exploit spatio-temporal adaptive natural variation, aiming to breed climate-adapted varieties. The research directions include: (1) resolution of spatio-temporal genomic natural variation in rice based on pangenome mapping and ancient DNA technology tools; (2) gene flow and genetic progressive penetration; (3) new method development and adaptive variation identification; (4) molecular genetic and evolutionary mechanisms of adaptive natural variation. To date, he has published 25 papers in international academic journals, which have been cited more than 2600 times. In the past five years, he has published many papers in Nature, Genome Research, Science Advances, Plant Cell and other high level journals as first author or co-first author. His research results have been selected and recommended as cover papers for many times and reported by Nature Genetics, The Atlantic, Asian Scientist and other well-known media.
