### About us
Wanglab have long been focused on the theories and methods of evolutionary genetics and have conducted empirical studies using various biological models, including rice. Their main research interests include analyzing patterns of natural variation in genomes, reconstructing key events in population history, and laying the foundation for understanding natural variation at the population level. By combining population genetics and molecular biology techniques, they have analyzed the genetic basis of important trait variation and revealed its evolutionary patterns.

### Research
The research group is currently using the genus Oryza as a model to delve into and utilize temporal and spatial adaptive natural variation in order to cultivate climate-adaptive varieties. Their research directions include: (1) analyzing temporal and spatial genome-wide natural variation in Oryza using pan-genome mapping and ancient DNA techniques; (2) gene flow and genetic introgression; (3) development of new methods and identification of adaptive variation; (4) molecular genetic and evolutionary mechanisms of adaptive natural variation.

Our research group has published 25 papers in international academic journals, which have been cited more than 2600 times. In the past five years, they have published several papers in high-level journals such as Nature, Genome Research, Science Advances, and Plant Cell, as first or co-first authors. Their research has been selected as cover papers and recommended several times, and has been reported on by well-known media such as Nature Genetics, The Atlantic, and Asian Scientist.

### Lab Culture

Our research group is very concerned with the creation of a positive laboratory culture, as we believe that it has a significant impact on the work efficiency and mental well-being of our team members. Therefore, we actively promote the establishment of a healthy research group culture.

Our research group is a team that enjoys challenges, is willing to innovate, and has a strong curiosity for science and technology. During work, we are happy to learn new knowledge, skills, and methods, continuously improving our personal abilities, while also having open communication and collaboration among team members to complete tasks together. During leisure time, our research group occasionally holds recreational activities to enhance the feelings and cohesion of our team members. Our group has an open and inclusive spirit, is good at accepting and respecting different opinions, cultures, and backgrounds, and everyone in the group is respected and has the right to be heard and have their opinions expressed.

If you are interested, you are welcome to join our research group.
