### Introduction to the Genome Institute
Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a new national research institute jointly organized by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Shenzhen Municipality. In the past four years since its establishment, the Institute has fulfilled its national mission of "leaping to the top of the world in agricultural science and technology and serving the major scientific and technological needs of the industry", served the strategic deployment of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the construction of the Shenzhen International Science and Technology Industrial Innovation Center, and built a leading international "germplasm resource collection - genome sequencing and analysis - functional gene We have introduced more than 40 internationally competitive PIs and recruited more than 150 postdocs;.

we have made outstanding achievements in the fields of basic agricultural biomics, genomics and plant and animal molecular breeding, genomics and plant and animal health. We have made outstanding achievements in the fields of basic agricultural biomics, genomics and plant and animal molecular breeding, genomics and plant and animal health, etc. We have published more than 300 SCI papers in Science, Nature, Cell, Nature Genetics and other famous journals, which have established the international status of Chinese agricultural genomics.

### Research

The research group is currently using the genus Oryza as a model to delve into and utilize temporal and spatial adaptive natural variation in order to cultivate climate-adaptive varieties. Their research directions include: (1) analyzing temporal and spatial genome-wide natural variation in Oryza using pan-genome mapping and ancient DNA techniques; (2) gene flow and genetic introgression; (3) development of new methods and identification of adaptive variation; (4) molecular genetic and evolutionary mechanisms of adaptive natural variation.

Our research group has published 25 papers in international academic journals, which have been cited more than 2600 times. In the past five years, they have published several papers in high-level journals such as Nature, Genome Research, Science Advances, and Plant Cell, as first or co-first authors. Their research has been selected as cover papers and recommended several times, and has been reported on by well-known media such as Nature Genetics, The Atlantic, and Asian Scientist.

### Lab Members

The members of our research group have expertise in a range of fields, including evolutionary genetics, bioinformatics, tomato breeding, and plant protection.

### Lab Culture

Our research group is very concerned with the creation of a positive laboratory culture, as we believe that it has a significant impact on the work efficiency and mental well-being of our team members. Therefore, we actively promote the establishment of a healthy research group culture.

Our research group is a team that enjoys challenges, is willing to innovate, and has a strong curiosity for science and technology. During work, we are happy to learn new knowledge, skills, and methods, continuously improving our personal abilities, while also having open communication and collaboration among team members to complete tasks together. During leisure time, our research group occasionally holds recreational activities to enhance the feelings and cohesion of our team members. Our group has an open and inclusive spirit, is good at accepting and respecting different opinions, cultures, and backgrounds, and everyone in the group is respected and has the right to be heard and have their opinions expressed.

If you are interested, you are welcome to join our research group.
